# Bachelor-Thesis-Data
This repository will serve as data storage for the data of my bachelor thesis "Trends in Knolwedge Managment".

Journal Data:
The web scraping files "Emerald Scrape per Volume", "igi_global Scrape per Volume" and "Wiley Scrape per Volume" were used to Scrape the data from the journals publishing pages.
The data of the journal "Knowledge Management Research & Practice (Palgrave Macmillan)" was retrieved by Web of Science.

Conference Data:
The HiCSS data was partly scraped with the file "HICSS Scrape per Volume" and partly retrieved manually. The ECKM data was downloaded from: https://search.proquest.com/publication/publications_1796412?accountid=29104# and the TAKE data was also retrieved manually.

The data was then cleaned manually via Excel and put into the format of a Web of Science output file. 
The file "VOS_ConferencesFull.csv" contains all data from conferences and the file "VOS_JournalsFull.csv" all data from Journals. Both files can be directly importet into the tool VOSViewer which was used to create the science maps in the thesis. https://www.vosviewer.com/
